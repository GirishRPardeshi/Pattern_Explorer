## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pattern-printing.git
cd pattern-printing
```
### 2️⃣ Run the Program
```bash
python patterns.py
```
### 📂 Project Structure
```bash
pattern-printing/
│
├── patterns.py           # Main script with all pattern logic
├── README.md             # Documentation file
└── LICENSE               # License (optional)
```

### 🛠️ Usage
You can uncomment the pattern function you want to execute or call multiple functions together.

Example:
```bash
# Call a pyramid pattern
pyramid_pattern(5)

# Call butterfly pattern
butterfly_pattern(7)
```
### 🖼️ Sample Output
**Diamond Pattern (Size = 5)**
```bash
    *
